DataMorph Extension Icon Instructions

To complete your DataMorph extension, you'll need to create an icon file named "datamorph-icon.png" in this directory.

Recommended specifications:
- Size: 128x128 pixels
- Format: PNG with transparency
- Colors: Use a color scheme that works well in both light and dark VS Code themes

Icon design suggestion:
- Create a simple icon representing data transformation
- Consider using shapes that transform from one format to another
- Use colors that represent the three supported formats (CSV, JSON, Excel)
- Keep the design clean and recognizable at small sizes

Once you've created your icon, place it in this directory with the filename "datamorph-icon.png" as referenced in the package.json file.
